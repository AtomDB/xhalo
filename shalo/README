The three S-lang files should go into the halo/ directory as drop-in
replacements for the existing material (I'd make sure to keep the
originals.).  The two fits files should go into the same directory as
the dsdO_2.20.fits and dsdO_3.30.fits files.  In your case, that's
/local/data/orcrist2/valencic/home_halo_fitting/ciao34/dat.

I'll note I have new versions of those dsdO files, but let's not
change more than we need to right now.  I'll also note that in my test
cases I'm finding that the Mie table version of shalox (HaloModel=4) is giving
similar shapes as the Exact RG version (HaloModel=3), but the norm
seems to be different.  This is probably due to me dropping a factor
of 2 or Pi or something somewhere; we'll have to get this tracked
down, but I wanted to give you something to start with.
